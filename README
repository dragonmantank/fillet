Fillet - A CMS to Sculpin Converter
===================================

Many people coming to Sculpin are coming from other CMSes out there in the wild. While almost all of these are
database-backed, Sculpin isn't. Fillet will help convert exports from different CMSes into the HTML/Markdown format
that Sculpin expects.

What this will /not/ do is create a Sculpin site from scratch from your existing blog. Fillet will simply parse a known
format and create pages and posts for you, and convert as much stuff over as possible. You still need to create an
index.html file, views, and configure Sculpin. We're just going to make it easier to get your content in.

If you have a favorite CMS and would like to help expand Fillet, help us write a parser!

Currently supported CMSes:
  - Wordpress, via the XML Export
